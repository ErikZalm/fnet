	$Date: Dec-17-2012$
	$Revision: 1.19 $
	
DESCRIPTION

	Use this file for C or C++.  Contains calls to initialize memory pools
	for use with malloc/free, exceptions and static initializers.  If your
	project does not use exceptions, then the initialization code for them 
	is stripped out.  If they are used, the linker will add them 
	automatically.  A C-only program will be a little smaller (160 bytes) 
	with __ppc_eabi_init.c.

	Interface for board-level initialization and user-level initialization.
	
	If hardware initialization and pre-main user initialization are required,
	copy this file to your project directory and customize it (instead of
	customizing __start.c).
	
	Note that __init_hardware should not write on the stack until the
	memory controller is properly configured.

	
	void __init_hardware(void)
	
		Initialize the hardware, including the memory controller.
	
	void __init_user(void)
	
		Allow the user to perform initialization before calling main().
	
	void __init_cpp(void)
	
		CodeWarrior C++ initialization before calling main().  Calls
		constructors of which the cpp exception handling initialization
		is the first constructor, if exceptions are used.
	
	void __fini_cpp(void)
	
		Calls destructors.
	
	void _ExitProcess(void)
 		
 		This function simply stalls the debugger.  You may want to rewrite this
 		function if you are using an OS.
	
 	abort and exit
 
 	In order to correctly implement the required startup/termination sequence for
 	C and C++ programs, we need to have an exit() routine that can be called by
 	the program startup code. The exit() routine is supposed to
 
 		(1)	call any functions registered via atexit()
 		(2) call destructors for any global objects
 		(3)	flush any unwritten buffers, close any open files, etc.
 		(4) terminates the program
 
 	We don't, however, want to require the ANSI C library for every CodeWarrior
 	program, since it drags in lots of code that may not be needed.
 
 	Instead we provide a dummy exit() function which simply calls the destructors
 	and terminates the program. We assume that any program which uses atexit()
 	or <stdio.h> and which requires those cleanup behaviors will have linked with
 	the ANSI C library, whose definition of exit() will override the one here.
 
 	We similarly define a dummy abort() function (which is called by the default
 	terminate() handler).
 
 	Programs which rely on the proper ANSI C/C++ behavior must use the ANSI C
 	library, and order it in the CodeWarrior project or command-line so that
 	its definitions supersede these definitions in the runtime support library.

HISTORY
	97 APR 17 LLY	Created.
	97 JUN 24 MEA	Added support for C++ and malloc memory heaps.
	97 JUN 26 MEA	Made C and C++ versions of this file.  Added abort and exit.
	97 JUL 17 SCM	Customized for MPC821 ADS board.
	97 JUL 20 MEA	Changed __exit to _ExitProcess so as not to conflict with MSL.
					_ExitProcess added to this file; removed form __start.c.
	99 JAN 22 MEA	Removed exception handing to __init_cpp_exceptions.c for use
					with 2.2.2 compiler (post Release 4).  Put prototypes for
					exit and abort within extern "C" to avoid name-mangling.

/***************************************************************************
*** Requirements for SDA PIC/PID ***

The basic requirement for SDA PIC/PID is that the startup code (.init) and
the segments .sdata and .sdata2 all maintain their link time address 
relationship at runtime.  In other words if the link time addresses are:
.init = 0x00002000
.sdata2 = 0x00003000
.sdata = 0x00004000
but that .init somehow is executed at 0x00002500, then those link time 
addresses must all increment by 0x00000500 for their runtime addresses.  
Any segment that does not maintain the address relationship at runtime is 
considered external and must be addressed with absolute addresses.  
Segments that do maintain their link time address relationship at runtime 
are considered internal and must be addressed with pc and sda relative 
addressing.  More on external and internal segments, below.

Having .init, .sdata2 and .sdata, as well as other internal segments, end
up at runtime without the link time relationship is not detected in this
runtime but it is at least technically possible for someone to modify the
runtime to support this, at least for a specific application.

*** Internal and External segments and references ***

At link time, the linker determines whether code and data segments are 
external or internal.  Internal segments reference their data as far or 
near offsets of the small data registers r2 and r13.  Their code 
references are normally pc relative, but if far code references are 
required, they also use offsets of the small data registers.  Internal
segments can also reference code and data in other internal segments
with the same addressing that they would use for their own code ad data.
By default, all segments in your application are considered internal with 
one exception listed below.

External segments are segments that are at absolute addresses.  
Segments with a name like .abs.xxxxxxxx, where xxxxxxxx is a hex address
are considered external.  External segments reference their data with 
absolute addressing and code references within the segment can be pc 
relative or absolute.  Any other segment must use absolute references 
to reference code or data in external segments.  External segments must 
reference an internal segment with small data registers for code and data.

Akin to external segments are external symbol references.  These are 
symbols, usually linker generated symbols, that are determined to be not 
within any segment in your application.  They will be referenced with
absolute addressing.  All symbols in an external segment are considered
to be external symbol references.

The ldf has 2 mechanisms for you to override the linker's defaults:
1.  The MEMORY directive now supports 
addr_mode = external | internal // default is internal
addr_mode is ignored unless you have chosen the SDA PIC/PID ABI in the EPPC 
Target Pref panel.

2. New directives INTERNAL_SYMBOL and EXTERNAL_SYMBOL can be used to force
the addressing of global symbols.  These directives are of the 
form XXXL_SYMBOL { sym1, sym2, symN } where the symbols are the link time
symbol names (mangled for c++).

The auto-generated linker defined start and end symbols for loadable 
segments are internal if they are addresses into internal segments and 
external if they are for external segments.  All other linker defined 
symbols you create in a lcf are considered external unless you redefine
them with INTERNAL_SYMBOL.  The linker also defines some linker defined 
symbols for its own use and they have the following default settings:

_stack_addr [top of the stack - comes from pref panel settings] external
_stack_end [bottom of the stack - comes from pref panel settings] external
_heap_addr [bottom of the heap - comes from pref panel settings] external
_heap_end [top of the heap - comes from pref panel settings] external
// the next two need to be treated as internal to be EABI compliant so
// you may not redefine them.
_SDA_BASE_ [.sdata + 0x00008000] internal
_SDA2_BASE_ [.sdata2 + 0x00008000] internal
// The previous small data pointers rely on the small data registers being
// properly initialized before being accessible.  However, it is hard to
// initialize those pointers without accessing them as absolutes.
// The following two symbols are external versions of _SDA_BASE_ and
// _SDA2_BASE_ which can be used as absolutes.  You may not redefine them.
_ABS_SDA_BASE_ [.sdata + 0x00008000] external
_ABS_SDA2_BASE_ [.sdata2 + 0x00008000] external
// the following are numbers, not addresses and they must be treated
// as external.  You may not redefine them.
_nbfunctions [number of functions in program - deprecated] external
SIZEOF_HEADERS [size of the segment headers in a linux app] external

Especially note that the stack and heap linker generated symbols are
external.  It may be more practical in a SDA PIC/PID application to
make the heap and stack be contiguous with an internal segment and
define them as internal.

*** Uses for SDA PIC/PID ***

The runtime was developed for 3 different situations:

1. All code and data segments are internal.  The simplest case would be
for all segments to use the same MEMORY directive and to have all of the 
bss type segments at the end.  In such a simple case, the application could
be converted to a binary file and linked into another application which
could copy it to ram and jump to its entry point.

2. All of the essential segments are internal and therefore moveable but 
there may be some external segments which are absolute.  This situation is 
probably difficult to test but you can download the entire application
to the chip and at least debug it at its link time addresses.

3. Like 2, there are internal and external segments but the application is 
linked as a ROM image - the application does not need to be flashed to
ROM, however.  It is possible to change the ROM Image Address to be an
address into RAM and have the debugger download the image to the RAM 
address.  Alternatively, you could have the ROM image converted to a bin
file and link it into another application as in 1, above.  The structures 
used in __init_data(), _rom_copy_info and __bss_init_info, have been 
modified for SDA PIC/PID to have an extra field which tells the runtime 
where the segment is internal or external so that the internal segments 
will be copied to position relative addresses and the external segments 
will be copied to absolute addresses.

*** Compiler/Linker support for SDA Addressing ***
You build a SDA PIC/PID application by selecting SDA PIC/PID in the ABI
popup in the EPPC Target Preference panel.  When you chose that, the 
compiler will define a simple that you can use to guard PIC/PID source.

#if __option(sda_pic_pid) // is true if you have chosen SDA PIC/PID ABI

If you then link, the linker will generate a table for the runtime files
__ppc_eabi_init.cpp/__ppc_eabi_init.c to use.  If your application has
absolute addressing relocations (which it would by default) you will
probably get linker warnings telling you that those relocations may
cause a problem.  If that happens, you have two choices.  You can change
the Code Model popup in the EPPC Target Preference panel to be
SDA Based PIC/PID Addressing for all of your sources and libraries, and/or
check the Tune Relocations checkbox in the EPPC Target Preference panel.
This new option is only available for the EABI and SDA PIC/PID ABIs.  For
EABI it changes 14 bit branch relocations to 24 bit branch relocations
only if they can not reach the calling site from the original relocation.
For SDA PIC/PID, it changes absolute addressed references of data from
code to use a small data register instead of r0 and changes absolute
code to code refernces to use the pc relative relocations.  In general,
this will work well for normnal compiled code.  It is always possible
to link in an assembly file that does not behave in a standard way.

Whether you use the Code Model SDA Based PIC/PID Addressing or not,
#pragma section has been modified to accept far_sda_rel for the data_mode
and code_mode options.  If you leave those options out, the compiler
will you the Code Model to determine the appropriate modes.

Absolute Addressing defaults to data_mode = far_abs and code_mode = pc_rel.
SDA Based PIC/PID Addressing defaults to data_mode = far_sda_rel and
code_mode = pc_rel.
